### **HOW:** 

#### *Planning Phase:*
- We came up with the concept of the app and gathered content and photographs that fit our theme.
- We saw some inspiration and the basis of news websites.
- we sketched some UX to work in using Figma.
- And finally we divided up the workload accordingly.

#### *Development Phase:*


We structured the application file and then the team agreed on guidelines to follow during development. 
The technologies and guidelines that we agreed to use and follow are:
##### Technologies
- HTML5 language and taking advantage of the Semantic elements. 
- CSS3.
- Git & Github.
- Making the pages responsive for 3 devices: Mobile, Tablet and Desktop.
- Vanilla Javascript (JS).


##### Guidlines
- First, the main page was worked on and divided into five sections. The first was the header and the last the footer, and between them are the sperated news sections.
- second, the article page has the same header and footer of the main, and contains two sections for the article and its element and comments with the commenting form.
